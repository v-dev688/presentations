Good Morning Apurva Kalia, myself Vasudev I have been working on the FM Geneformer specifically one of its downstream task called Insilico Perturbation.

Situation
-----------------------------------------------------
What is insilico perturbation - As geneformer is transformer based model and if we are given a classification task to it and extract embeddings and cluster it in a 2 Dimensional space it clusturs according to these training labels, somewhat it looks like this.
This process is done on induced pluripotent state of cell

So our main aim is to identify genes whose inhibition can shift the embeddings from tumour state to healthy state/ Senescent state



Queries
---------------------------------------------------------
Of course the primary challenge - is to fine tune it for cancer domain firstly to distinguish the cell states . Tomour/Healthy


Challenges I faced
---------------------------------------------------------
Sample dataset were not available at first
Learning curve - understanding the dataformat, its ML side, code understanding, The cellular biology (thankfully Vidhi, AMit, harshit and Bikash was there)

Solution
-----------------------------------------------------------
