Good Morning Everyone, So the Foundation Model I have been working on is called Geneformer, more specifically one of its downstream application-Inslico Perturbation

Geneformer avaible in 5 variants
*
*
*
*
* Pretraining with larger and more diverse data can improve classification performace


before explaining whats insilico perturbation is one need to understand what is IPSC state (induced Pluripotent state)
The cell embeddings generated by geneformer is in the iPSC state - where the change in expression level of genes can shift the embedddings from one state to another
This embedding shift is calculated by cosine similarity & this perturbation can be done by deleting a gene one at a time or in pairs
While explaining pairs Vidhi got the idea of Synthetic lethality pairs - "where deletion or inhibition of gene pairs can cause the cell to die" - thats how we might be able to 
identify lethality pairs and elimate cancer cells.

What's available?

The good thing is Geneformer's original hugging repository contained an example of how to do Insilico Perturbation done on Cardiomyopathy
where they had dataset to construct 3 clusturs - nonfailing hearts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy 
and the authors were able to identify the genes whose deletion in both the states can shift the embeddings in its pluripotent state

Cell embeddings can be constructed from both Pretrained model and FineTuned Model after classification


Our Plan

Construct the IPSC cell embedding clusturs for colorectal cancer and do insilico deletion/ inhibition of gene pairs and identify the gene pairs in colorectal cancer that can shift the embeddings to senescent state or cell death
